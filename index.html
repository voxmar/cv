    <h2>Key Skills</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Analysis: Using a machine learning algorithm to identify informative data from a survey ensured that my client did not eliminate highly significant information from their survey results, leading to more in-depth data collection. </li>
            <li>Collaborative Working: I collaborated with a group of colleagues to promote Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) within the organisation. I took the lead in creating agendas for our meetings and assigned actionable tasks to team members, which resulted in several quick wins for the group.</li>
            <li>Continued Improvement: Led a small team of developers to iteratively develop, test and implement tester and user feedback for in house project management software.</li>
            <li>Project Management: I took control of a project that was falling behind schedule. By reevaluating tasks, reducing their scope, redistributing responsibilities, and implementing weekly check-ins to monitor progress, I successfully moved the project forward to the beta testing phase and gathered feedback from testers.</li>
            <li>Automisation: Wrote Python scripts and built ETL pipelines to automatically update company databases.</li>
            <li>Stakeholder Engagement: Proven skills in leading stakeholder engagement to ensure collaborative working across multiple departments, leading to successful project outcomes. </li>
            <li>Dashboard Creation: Significant experience in developing dashboards that enable clients to drill down into specific data points for easier and quicker analysis both in PowerBI and RShiny.</li>
            <li>Problem Solving: My experience in managing complex issues led to effective, cost-saving solutions that ensured the project was completed on time and within budget.</li>
        </ul>
